# Multi Language Invoice Extractor

## Overview
The **Gemini Invoice Extractor** is a Streamlit-based web application that utilizes **Google's Gemini AI** to extract and interpret data from invoices. Users can upload an image of an invoice and ask questions about the contents, receiving AI-generated responses based on the image.

## Features
- Upload an invoice image (JPG, JPEG, PNG)
- Extract information using **Google Gemini AI**
- Ask questions related to the uploaded invoice
- Display AI-generated responses in real-time

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install streamlit google-generativeai pillow python-dotenv
```

cd gemini-invoice-extractor
```

### 2. Set Up the API Key
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory

## Code Structure

## Troubleshooting
- **API Key Error**: Ensure you have a valid **Google API Key** and it is correctly placed in the `.env` file.
- **File Upload Issue**: Only JPG, JPEG, and PNG formats are supported.
- **Slow Response**: May be due to API rate limits or network issues.
